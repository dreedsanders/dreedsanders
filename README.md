- 👋 Hi, I’m Donovan Sanders
- 👀 I’m interested in creating reactive web pages and building relational databases. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Ruby on Rails
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web pages that allow the user to freely move through the application. I want to learn to build scalable applications    that require little to no customization.
